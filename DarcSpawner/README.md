# DarcSpawner
Spawns vehicles (could work with containers too) randomly on map with some loot.

## Installation
Just active the mod (and dependencies) and you're good to go.

## Configuration parameters
Configuration is done in .json files.

# Configuration files
The configuration files will be under your ```profile\DarcMods_conf\*```. Depending on the usage the profile is in your ArmaReforger, ArmaReforgerWorkbench or in your server profile directory. For example ```C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\ArmaReforger\profile\DarcMods_conf```.

For examples of configuration files see [ExampleConfigs](https://github.com/mokdevel/DarcMods/tree/main/DarcSpawner/ExampleConfigs).
